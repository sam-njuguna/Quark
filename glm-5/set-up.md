# Claude Code

> Methods for Using the GLM Coding Plan in Claude Code

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows -- all through natural language commands.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is even more powerful with the [GLM Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?utm_source=zai\&utm_medium=link\&utm_term=devpack-integration\&utm_campaign=Platform_Ops&_channel_track_key=w3mNdY8g)— giving you 3× the usage at a fraction of the cost. Code faster, debug smarter, and manage workflows seamlessly with more tokens, and rock-solid reliability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  After successfully configuring the subscription, the default server model mapping is applied, where you see the Claude model in the interface but the GLM model is actually used. \
  You can manually adjust the model mapping (not recommended), see the "How to Switch the Model in Use" section in the FAQ for more details.
</Tip>

      <Tab title="Automated Script">
        Just run the following command in your terminal \
        Attention only macOS Linux environment is supported, this method does not support Windows

        ```bash  theme={null}
        curl -O "https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/install/claude_code_zai_env.sh" && bash ./claude_code_zai_env.sh
        ```

        The script will automatically modify `~/.claude/settings.json` to configure the following environment variables(You don't need to edit manually):

        ```json  theme={null}
        {
            "env": {
                "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_zai_api_key",
                "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",
                "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "3000000"
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Manual configuration">
        If you have previously configured environment variables for Claude Code, you can manually configure them as follows. A new window is required for the changes to take effect.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash MacOS & Linux theme={null}
          # Edit the Claude Code configuration file `~/.claude/settings.json`
          # Add or modify the env fields ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          {
              "env": {
                  "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_zai_api_key",
                  "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",
                  "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "3000000"
              }
          }
          ```

          ```cmd Windows Cmd theme={null}
          # Run the following commands in Cmd
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          setx ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN your_zai_api_key
          setx ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
          ```

          ```powershell Windows PowerShell theme={null}
          # Run the following commands in PowerShell
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN', 'your_zai_api_key', 'User')
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL', 'https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic', 'User')
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

## FAQ

### How to Switch the Model in Use

<Check>
  Mapping between Claude Code internal model environment variables and GLM models, with the default configuration as follows:

- `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
- `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
- `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`: `GLM-4.5-Air`
  </Check>

<Note>
  Note: Max users using GLM-5 need to manually change the model to "glm-5" in the custom configuration (e.g., `~/.claude/settings.json` in Claude Code).
</Note>

If adjustments are needed, you can directly modify the configuration file (for example, \~/.claude/settings.json in Claude Code) to switch to other models.

<Note>
  It is generally not recommended to manually adjust the model mapping, as hardcoding the model mapping makes it inconvenient to automatically update to the latest model when the GLM Coding Plan models are updated.
</Note>

<Note>
  If you want to use the latest default mappings (for existing users who have configured old model mappings), simply delete the model mapping configuration in `settings.json`, and Claude Code will automatically use the latest default models.
</Note>

1. Configure `~/.claude/settings.json` with the following content:

```text theme={null}
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "glm-4.5-air",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "glm-4.7",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "glm-4.7"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Note: Max users using GLM-5 need to manually change the model to "glm-5" in the custom configuration (e.g., `~/.claude/settings.json` in Claude Code).
</Note>

2. Open a new terminal window and run `claude` to start Claude Code, enter `/status` to check the current model status.

### Vision Search Reader MCP

Refer to the [Vision MCP Server](/devpack/mcp/vision-mcp-server) , [Search MCP Server](/devpack/mcp/search-mcp-server) and [Web Reader MCP Server](/devpack/mcp/reader-mcp-server) documentation; once configured, you can use them in Claude Code.

### Manual Configuration Not Work

If you manually modified the `~/.claude/settings.json` configuration file but found the changes did not take effect, refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

- Close all Claude Code windows, open a new command-line window, and run `claude` again to start.
- If the issue persists, try deleting the `~/.claude/settings.json` file and then reconfigure the environment variables; Claude Code will automatically generate a new configuration file.
- Confirm that the JSON format of the configuration file is correct, check the variable names, and ensure there are no missing or extra commas; you can use an online JSON validator tool to check.

### Recommended Claude Code Version

We recommend using the latest version of Claude Code. You can check the current version and upgrade with the following commands:

> We have verified compatibility with Claude Code 2.0.14 and other versions.

```bash theme={null}
# Check the current version
